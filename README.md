## About this assignment
### Project's description: 
In the modern web, the applications are mostly made on top of countless amounts of libraries and frameworks. But just using all this technology without knowledge about their inner workings is not wise for someone seeking to become a good professional and create a successful career.

In this Project, each group will create an Interactive and Responsive Web Application using fundamental web technologies.

Agile methodologies such as User Stories, Backlog, Status Meetings and Sprints should be used to organize the group work.
